# Implementing a recommender system in R

One of the  killer applications of  Recommender Systems is the conversion rate optimization: customers find relevant products faster, cross-selling happens on a substantiated way and as a side effect, your image as a brand improves, as your attempt to be relevant for your customers is usually appreciated as value-adding, which also positively impacts the customer loyalty. Thatâ€™s why we are going to focus on this use case  
We are not going to implement everything from scratch. There are a few R packages implementing collaborative filtering engines, but I like recommenderlab the most.
